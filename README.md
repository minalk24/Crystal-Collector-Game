## Description
  How Game works:- 

* There will be four crystals displayed as pokemon buttons on the page.

* The user will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

* When the user clicks on a pokemon, it will add a specific amount of points to the user's total score.

* The user wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

* The user loses if their score goes above the random number.

* The game restarts whenever the user wins or loses.
